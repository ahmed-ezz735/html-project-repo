                Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans.
                One of the best-known technologies is IBM’s Watson. It understands natural language and can respond to questions asked of it. 
                The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. 
                AI is a study realized to emulate human intelligence into computer technology that could assist both, the doctor and the patients in the following ways:

                    Robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans. 
                    Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM (Customer relationship management) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. 
                    Chatbots have already been incorporated into websites and e companies to provide immediate service to customers. 
                    Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT consultancies.

                    AI systems can use the materials of a traditional syllabus to create customized textbooks for certain subjects. 
                    Such systems digitize this course material and create new learning interfaces to help students of all academic grades and ages.
                    <h><b>Creating Personalized Learning Experiences</b></h>
                    There’s a quote by Albert Einstein, which says that “Everybody is a genius, but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, 
                    it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” No two students are the same, or learn in exactly the same way.
                    By providing customizable tutoring and studying support applications, AI can adapt educational frameworks to cater to individuals’ 
                    needs according to their abilities, interests, and aptitude.

            <p>
                <b>
                    Just like humans, self-driving cars need to have sensors to understand the world around them and a brain to collect, 
                    processes and choose specific actions based on information gathered. Autonomous vehicles are with advanced tool to gather information, 
                    including long range radar, cameras, and LIDAR. Each of the technologies are used in different capacities and each collects different information. 
                    This information is useless, unless it is processed and some form of information is taken based on the gathered information. 
                    This is where artificial intelligence comes into play and can be compared to human brain. AI has several applications for these vehicles and among them the more immediate ones are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Directing the car to gas station or recharge station when it is running low on fuel.</b>

                    will allow us to address the challenges in taking care of an aging population and allow much longer independence. 
                    It will drastically reduce, may be even bring down traffic accidents and deaths, 
                    as well as enable disaster response for dangerous situations for example the nuclear meltdown at the fukushima power plant.

                <b>
                    One of the main limitations of being human is simply our own bodies and brains. Researcher Shimon Whiteson thinksthat in the future, 
                    we will be able to augment ourselves with computers and enhance many of our own natural abilities. Though many of these possible cyborg enhancements would be added for convenience, 
                    others may  serve a more practical purpose. Yoky Matsuka of Nest believes that AI will become useful for people with amputated limbs, 
                    as the brain will be able to communicate with a robotic limb to give the patient more control. This kind of cyborg technology would significantly reduce the limitations that amputees deal with daily.

      <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
      <p>
          <b>
            In the future, predictive analytics and artificial intelligence could play an even more fundamental role in content creation and also in the software fields. 
            Open source information and artificial intelligence collection will provide opportunities for global technological parity and the technology of artificial can become the future in all the domains of health, 
            environment, public safety and security.
