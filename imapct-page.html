    <h1><b>Impacts of Artificial Intelligence on Society</b></h1>
    <p>
        <b>
            Artificial intelligence can dramatically improve the efficiencies of our workplaces and can augment the work humans can do. 
            When AI takes over repetitive or dangerous tasks, it frees up the human workforce to do work they are better equipped for—tasks that involve creativity and empathy among others. 
            If people are doing work that is more engaging for them, it could increase happiness and job satisfaction.

            With better monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, artificial intelligence can dramatically influence healthcare. 
            By improving the operations of healthcare facilities and medical organisations, AI can reduce operating costs and save money. 
            One estimate from McKinsey predicts big data could save medicine and pharma up to $100B annually. The true impact will be in the care of patients. 
            Potential for personalised treatment plans and drug protocols as well as giving providers better access to information across medical facilities to help inform patient care will be life-changing.

            Our society will gain countless hours of productivity with just the introduction of autonomous transportation and 
            AI influencing our traffic congestion issues not to mention the other ways it will improve on-the-job productivity. 
            Freed up from stressful commutes, humans will be able to spend their time in a variety of other ways.
            <br>
            The way we uncover criminal activity and solve crimes will be enhanced with artificial intelligence. 
            Facial recognition technology is becoming just as common as fingerprints. The use of AI in the justice system also presents 
            many opportunities to figure out how to effectively use the technology without crossing an individual’s privacy.
            <br>
            Unless you choose to live remotely and never plan to interact with the modern world, your life will be significantly impacted by artificial intelligence. 
            While there will be many learning experiences and challenges to be faced as the technology rolls out into new applications, 
            the expectation will be that artificial intelligence will generally have a more positive than negative impact on society.
